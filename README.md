# Agentic AI System

A sophisticated, modular AI agent system that can plan, execute, learn, and adapt to complex tasks.

## Features

- **Task Planning**: Breaks down complex goals into actionable steps
- **Tool Usage**: Integrates with external APIs and systems
- **Learning & Adaptation**: Improves performance based on feedback
- **Memory Management**: Maintains context across conversations
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend with new capabilities
- **Async Support**: Handles concurrent operations efficiently

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

3. **Run the agent**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
